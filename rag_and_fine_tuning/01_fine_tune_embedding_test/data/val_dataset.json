(\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\n Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in transportation  management.The acquisition  of Transplace

Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Platform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.Massive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.Product Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.We intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users.Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users.For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered.Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber.Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\n as a subscription offering.Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers.We exited\n 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.", "d9c99b59-2082-40a5-bafa-1896a4c27f6a": "In 2020, we rolled out our\u201cSuper App\u201d

marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform adver\ntising formats.During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\nWe\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5", "e913a33d-d1a3-444f-a3dc-7b7974c66517": "these industries.As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition.While\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do.The competition we fa\nce in each of our offerings includes:\u2022\nMobility.Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.In addition,public\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\nre.\u2022\nDelivery.Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and\n merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.OurDelivery offering also c\nompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H.Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Government Regulation\nWe operate\n in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment.Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and\n regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,\n labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation.These laws and regulations areconstantly\n evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des\ncribed below.Mobility\nOur\n platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions\n in  which  we  operate.A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo\nreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In\n the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including\n licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements.Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and\n regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including\n Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations\n banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi\nties for our business and operating model.Substantially\n all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.These r\negulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles\n to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp\nections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In\n addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.", "ebf0314b-e7a1-48cd-b630-1b367264fbc5": "For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill\n 5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.The  CaliforniaAttorney\n General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction  and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged  misclassification  of drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj\noining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the\n parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot\n initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able\n to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith\n the provisions of Proposition 22.See

adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business.For example:\u2022\nIn London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.In November2019,\n TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement\n processes.We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same condi\ntions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements,\n including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing\n requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on\n our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\u2022\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be pi\ncked up by ridesharing drivers.In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon\n the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services.In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime\n and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on\n our platform.As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour\n platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement\n minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to

for our busin\ness and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we \nmay be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and Protection\nOur\n technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,

California in November2020 (effective in Janua\nry 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial Services\nMost\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments\n B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the\u201cEEA\u201d).Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are

require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual rel\nationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in

intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our propri\netary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and Development\nBecause\n the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability\n to  ensure  a

revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typicallygenerate\n lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America andEurope.We have typically \nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19\n pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande\nmic continues.Delivery\nWe\n typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical\n growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc\nelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe\n are  a  global

culture we need thro\nugh employee engagement surveysand\n related  tools.We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.But in2021,\n we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month.We use the results ofthese regular checks to\n better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth\n opportunities.For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased\n on employee feedback.In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri\ncs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee\n Development  and  Retention.We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to d\nrive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough\n internal mobility programs.Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem\n to have an impact on other areas of the business.Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness\n and  productivity.This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life\u2019s  expected  and  unexpected

 that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment\n that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows.To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses\n throughout Uber and measure progress.For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people\n with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically \nunderrepresented groups.Our\n Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior

Well-Being\nIn\n addition  to  employees  discussed  above,  our  business  also  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  and  engage  Drivers,  consumers,  Merchants,  shippers,  andCouriers, as well as contrac\ntors and consultants that support our global operations.In\n relation  to  those  individuals  who  earn  income  on  our  platform,  Uber  is  one  of  the  largest  open  platforms  for  work  in  the  world,  providing  accessible,flexible work in approxima\ntely 72 countries.Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created9", "890be75d-3ed5-4311-8846-f430721a8523": "through its apps.A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent.We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work.Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers.However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes.Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive.The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.This does not have to be the case.AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\u2022\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.We believe all workshould\n be treated equally.We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net.This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp\n based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app.Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward.Pursuant tothis\n change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible.We have also annou\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022\nProtections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami\nly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022\nEngagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform.We

pricing modelsof\n our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts.In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot\n believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th\ne outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,\n adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,\n foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019\n behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand\n for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.In\n addition, we cannot predict  the impact  the COVID-19 pandemic  will have on our business partners  and third-party  vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as\n a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer.", "e410fae5-f188-4dbc-90ed-a4488ff973fc": "Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic\n have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks\n described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our busin\ness, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Driv\ners were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\nform services on our platform.Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13", "81ddd18d-422a-4a35-856b-f75a2980d411": "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims.We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021.Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions.For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020.Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22.Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions.For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction.If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions.If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices.Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform.Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).", "35cb1282-d4f7-43bf-a9c5-28e124b1c797": "Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward.Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan.Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations.For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union.If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting\n Estimates\u201d  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  \u201cNotes  to  the Consolidated

delivery, and logistics industries.We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\n fragmented.We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\n entry that characterize these industries.In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low.Consumers have a propensity

shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car\nriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,\n while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan\n we  do.As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers\n value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products.Increased competitioncould\n result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.We face competit\nion in each of our offerings, including:\u2022\nMobility .Our  Mobility  offering

Driver incentives aDriver\n receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip.In certain geographic markets andregions,\n we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand\n promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions.We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions\n will be successful.Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect,\n our financial performance.Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified\n over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction.We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Driver\ns. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe\n application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application.If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in \nthe future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compet\ne have attracted significant investments

large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain\n of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe\n future.These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete moreeffectively\n against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,\n shippers,  and

substantial increases in our operating expenses,as we\n continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,and\n promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hireadditional employees;

of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform.We haveexperienced and expect \nto continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to\n be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket,\n we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that\n market.Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply\n of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform.Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific\n geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay\n lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill\n become less appealing to consumers and merchants.A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups\n and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient\n opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our

sentiment.We\n have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust\n of our company.Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult\n for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny,\n and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations.Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their inves\ntments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we\n released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on\n our platform in the United States.The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to h\nave occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto\n result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.Furtherunfavorable\n media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes\n increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave\n an amplified effect on our various platform offerings.", "e03d2f17-48e4-4d77-aecf-1843e47dbf25": "Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have\n or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage

have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures\n and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual\n protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers

safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour\n reputation and business may be harmed.As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.While\n we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood\n reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quali\nty of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts.Our brand promotion, reputation building,

will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand\n in the current or future competitive environment

significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may inthe\n future  continue  to  harm,  our  business  results  and  financial  condition.Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.Although we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have

sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies\n in operational and strategic objectives.Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay\n not be successful.Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged\n to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions.Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b\ne successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across

our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal\n financial control and reporting functions.We may not be able to manage our growth

approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States.We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally.Pr\noperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including\n engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology.If our newhires\n perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and\n staff, our business may be harmed.Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce\n and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin\n workforce.Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the\n distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor\n us  to  hire  new  employees

us related to Driver conduct.We have also faced civillitigation\n alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform.If Drivers or\n carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not con\nsider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour\n business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business.There have been numerous incidents andallegations\n worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging\n in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform.Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing\n our platform,  Drivers  and merchants  may be unwilling  to continue using our platform.In addition,  certain  regions  where we operate  have high rates  ofviolent\n crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions.For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers\n and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform.Ifother\n criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and finan\ncial results could be adversely affected.Public\n reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or thi\nrd parties such

injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers,\n or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform.On a smaller scale, wemay\n face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties.Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous.Inaddition, the\n growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers\n and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle.For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven\n roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries.", "df94a77a-fad9-4c20-803d-39cfd2c2b991": "In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need\n to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours,all of which heighten the potential risk\n of injuries or death.Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare\n exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability.These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating\n costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects.Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de\nfending against them.As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making

adverselyimpacted.We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability.23", "70a1b711-495d-4fd3-85f9-5712a430802a": "We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports.If our operations in largemetropolitan\n areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted.In\n 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingd\nom.We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand\n consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible\n to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases\n or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate.Any short-term o\nr long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor\n pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas.An economic downturn, increased competition,or\n regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than\n would the occurrence of such events in other areas.In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour\n ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business.Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting\n licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan\n area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.In\n addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe\n number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment \nformula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers\n on our platform.These minimum rates took effect in February 2019.Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance\n in New York City and may continue to do so in the future.Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips\n in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco.This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or\n may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices\n on our platform.Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller\n and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban\n and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be \nlimited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,\n we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport.As a result of this concentration, ouroperating\n results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.", "27eee836-fe75-4bcd-84eb-297917a94557": "In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom\n airports.Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility\n and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating\n that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing\n operations altogether.Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite\n permits.Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or\n Drivers.Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,\n the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.While wehave\n entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,\n we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor\nts in all jurisdictions.If\n we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those\n offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad\nversely impacted.We\n have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the\n combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh\naring24", "34a46bd2-a541-43a2-ba14-a542e297ae48": "network.We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities.Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects.For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform.If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities.Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened.Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies\n that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor\n us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal\n and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing.Theseregulations\n could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform.If regulations of this nature are implemented,we\n may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all.Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic.A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office.Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover.",

plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge

unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending.Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases.Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses.Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering.If spending atmany\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results.Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt.Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\n control of these parties.In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\n alternative sources of income.Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\n our platform to decline.A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\nating results.If\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor

assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.Forexample, in\n April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto\n certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018.If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity\n breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant \nliabilities.If\n we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat\ning results would be adversely affected.To\n continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new\n products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors.Forexample, in\n January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider\n destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc\ne of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing\n and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends\n on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.Moreover, any suchnew\n or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.For  example,  some  productchanges\n in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction,

internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult\n in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position.If the internal systems and toolswe\n use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate.Whilethese\n numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring\n how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough\n we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior.In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe\n measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies.If our operating metrics\n or our estimates of our category

operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected.In\n certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns.If we do not succes\nsfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and\n Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers\n to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun\nted for approximately 7% of our global27", "ac3ed609-4c8a-43a1-b4d1-3cde99dbfb04": "Gross  Bookings.This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns.For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing.Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions.In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts.In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported.If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips.We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers.Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us.Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws.If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation.Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card.As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model.We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard\n (the \u201cStandard\u201d).The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures.Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards.Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard.Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts.In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating\n rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or

adverse effect on our financialposition\n and operating results.In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.Ourtax\n positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which\n could  impact  our  financial  position.In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses\n and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses\n and arrangements.Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions\n or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve\nrsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff\nect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We\n are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.U.S. tax legislation

U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity,

South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation.In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit.For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes.We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes.Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit.Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s\n Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services.Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in

requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject.", "db6bf89c-7772-43bd-9dc3-c8182f570105": "For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only.In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.These minimum rates took effect in February 2019.Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future.In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion.InAugust\n 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020.Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\nates.If other35", "8c0b5cb5-d9d0-436a-8ae5-5c5eef508541": "jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain\n jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe\n believe are invalid or inapplicable.In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\n operations are fully compliant.For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance.We are considering further legalchallenges\n and possible policy solutions.However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial\n performance in Hong Kong.As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat\n we  violated  local  competition  laws.In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia.Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations.Our decision tocontinue\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities.Our continuation of thispractice\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed.Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue.In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications.In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering.We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\n business model in many jurisdictions.To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict\ning, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings.A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,\n and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe\n operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users.We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.Further,\n existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,\n and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform.",

and state laws and regulations.Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\n or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform.We are activelychallenging\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices.Further,\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\n emissions may impact our business.For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\n electric vehicles by 2025.Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023.Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide.Our failure to share such data in accordancewith\n these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o\nr indefinite

Brexit.The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate.We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business.Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers.These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\n discrimination, safety, and employment.For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of\n Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof\n Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017.The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and

e-scooters throug\nh our app.We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings.For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl\nuding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues\n of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct.For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both.If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\n significant  fines or penalties,  require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions  that limit or require  us to modify our operations,including\n limitations

licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe\n future growth of our business.We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations\n before being granted such licenses.If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business\n37", "8a1a50f5-32ed-4ecf-ac81-2670f08fca19": "operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped\n of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers.Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements.In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction.These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by those users.A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation.These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions.Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties.", "19841e2d-4f4e-4600-8dfc-60f6cc52e5f8": "We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.We\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and otherU.S.and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\nf which could harm our business.We\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad.Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded.We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters.For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year.In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018.In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach.The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators.As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport.We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538", "6be88626-324b-4d3a-b031-bad8eba7e6e0": "million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021.Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel\nl as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.We\n are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.These\n government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange\n our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions.Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational\n harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations.Any of these deve\nlopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We\n face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act\nion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The\n nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These\n and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws.Suchviolations\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability.Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved.In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\n consumer information through 2038.In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\n failure to report security incidents.In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\n million.We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies.In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\n of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices.In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments\n with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand\n assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement\n actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced\n by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations.For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities\n that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,\n 2018.If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat\n Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed \nand may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This\n risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,\n we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018.The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data.", "1f33e776-5b68-4dc8-a889-458f3982a056": "Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.TheGDPR\n further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories\n of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual\n decision-making.Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\n our business and financial condition.Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\n including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.Otherjurisdictions outside\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance.For example, the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst\n businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.Other U.S.states\n have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.Brazilprovides\n another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These\n laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)\n39", "d7f7fdf5-3df5-413d-a3ca-2571b4c1173f": "passed in California in November 2020.Additionally,\n we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata\n outside the EEA.We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses.Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and \njudicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy\n of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If\n we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal\n data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be\n required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor\n obtaining or maintaining  a license  or otherwise, from law enforcement  agencies,  and from intelligence  agencies.This disclosure  may result in a failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, n\notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe\n same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand.In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain\n government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership.We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and\n ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto\n suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary\n or indefinite basis.Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co\nmply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions.This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off\nerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such\n data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance\n requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent.Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,\n and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs.Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure\n by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,\n consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others.We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound\n liable, significant damages.Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were \nto occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse\n litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.We\n have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings\n by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others.We aresubject\n to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty\n infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices.The results of any suchlitigation,\n investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,\n costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.", "cc00b75b-9e3c-4c87-a70d-03f61bbf3e44": "If  any  of  these  legalproceedings\n were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate ou\nr business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess\n for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court.However, arbitration maybecome more\n costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome.Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks\n to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny.To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe\n future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour\n litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform use\nrs and employees.Further,\n with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween\n state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould\n experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adve\nrsely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40", "8a5e0b24-52b4-4df3-abe8-989cf0d10365": "We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously

the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the\n purpose of obtaining or retaining business.U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional\n compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to

our control.Ouracquisition\n of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar\n with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance\n programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users\n and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers\n may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.Many\n Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions.However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\non company.Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\n adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations.In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi\ntations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil\nity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We\n operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense.In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers\n may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs\n against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p\nrogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages.In addition, in early 2017,we\n settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs.Inconnection with\n this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress.These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,\n and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.", "a6392e11-ea05-400a-af7b-e23e783a984e": "Our\n business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of

additional insurance for otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl\ny with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.Insurance related toour\n Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers.We rely on alimited\n number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee\n that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile\n insurance  coverage

by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.While management

codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional\n legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.Further, serviceproviders\n and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts

require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat\nions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue\n is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings.Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions.For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer\n fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,\n in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased

sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation.If a company we acquire or in which we havean\n interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investmentmay materially decline.Any\n intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019sattention\n and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand.These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and mayresult\n in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights.Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings cou\nld adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.We\n may  be  required  or  may  opt  to  seek  a  license  for  the  right  to  use  intellectual  property  held  by  others,  which  may  not  be  available  on  commerciallyreasonable\n terms,  or  at  all.Even  if  a  license  is  available,  we  may  be  required  to  pay  significant  royalties  or  license  fees,  which  may  increase  our  operatingexpenses.We may\n also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effortand\n expense  and  make  us  less  competitive.If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing\n aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions.Any ofthese results could harm ou\nr operating results.Our reported financial results may be adverse\nly affected by changes in accounting principles.The accounting\n for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel,\n interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new  regulations,  and  changes  in  SEC  or  other  agency  policies,  rules,regulations,\n and  interpretations,  of  accounting  regulations.",

expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially\n different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reportingcontrols.If we are deemed an investment company under the Inv\nestment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.The\n Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conducttheir business activities.We believe that\n we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d underthe\n Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China),\n referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe\n are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act.While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment\n company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment\n Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse\n effect on our financial condition.To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements\n of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business.For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon \nthe sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe\n market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, theeffectiveness of\n our internal control over financial reporting.In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof\n our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably li\nkely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The\n process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging,\n and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion.As our business continues to grow in sizeand\n complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company.During the \nevaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we \nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We\n cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings\n (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls.Any failure to maintaininternal\n control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.If  we  are  unable  toconclude\n that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness\n in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice\n of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor\n other regulatory authorities.Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control system\ns, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF\n COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2.PROPERTIES\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we leased and owned office facilities around the world totaling

administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions\n that  may be taken  by governmental  authorities,  the further  impact  on the business of Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and business partners,  and otherfactors identified \nin Part I, Item 1A.\u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification Developments\nThe\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020,\n the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior\n Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused\n by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.Foll\nowing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe\n preliminary injunction.", "e9301e3a-3b6e-4e2a-a194-4fbb1634422b": "In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for \nindependent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary\n injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.In\n January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which\n was denied.The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition\n 22 is unconstitutional.On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Servic\nes has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we\n have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor\n for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financia\nl position, or cash flows.Also\n of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be \nclassified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent49", "b9534590-baf6-4cd4-a8a1-d8cadadac879": "contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018.We app\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling.Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers.Damages may includ\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\n Uber.They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\nntation.The pension regulator hasconfirmed\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers.Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.",

Delivery Gross Bookings grew66% from\n 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related toCOVID-19, as\n well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increasein\n certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers forservices provided. Mobility Gross Bookings g\nrew 36%, on a constant currency basis, from 2020, due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from theimpacts of COVID-19.\nRevenue\n was $17.5 billion, or up 57% year-over-year, reflecting the overall growth in our Delivery business and an increase in Freight revenue attributable tothe\n acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase involumes with our top shippers.\nNet\n loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $496 million, a 93% improvement year-over-year, driven by a $1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of ourATG\n Business to Aurora, a $1.6 billion pre-tax  net benefit relating to Uber\u2019s equity investments, as  well as reductions in our fixed cost structure and increasedvariable cost effi\nciencies.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated\n to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand\n related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability\n to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter\n 2020 planned cost structure.

thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe\n derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery\n offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers.Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived.Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives.End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\nWe\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\n values.The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Suchvaluations\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.Management's\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired\n finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During\n the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset \nto goodwill.",

convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.These embedded features are composed ofconversion\n options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber\n of shares  of our common  stock delivered  to settle  these embedded  features  will have a fixed value.These conversion options are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying\n instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated\n balance  sheet.We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid\nated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We\n value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option \n(\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d).The fair value of these

various potential QIPOdates\n to the valuation date.The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which\n was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect th\ne yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon\n closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.For

Form10-K.\nInvestments\u2014Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\nWe\n hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which wedo not\n have a controlling interest or significant influence.Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare\n subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments\n in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe\n changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equi\nty securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments\n in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.This valuation requiresjudgment\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.In determining the estimatedfair\n value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the\n investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities.In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.If anequity\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\n statement of operations.Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\n cost.In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\n the security\u2019s amortized cost.In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.The factorsconsidered\n in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof\n the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe\n present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.A credit-related\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\n (loss), net of tax.", "82888fee-bc4a-42cb-b8a1-4468c9f8c439": "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nWe\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.Subsequently, werecognize\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 netincome or\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences.In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter inarrears.Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.We\n review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment\n may  not  be  fully  recoverable.Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv\nestees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors.If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul\nd have to be determinedand an\n impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately \nheld companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates

impairmentcharges.Goodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe\n review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  (in  the  fourth  quarter)  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  goodwill  might  beimpaired.We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues\n for each of our reporting units.Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate perf\normance, and allocate resources.Judgment\n in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business,\n and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting\n unit.To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.Performing\n a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,risk-adjusted discount\n rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We\n review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations,\n settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and theestimated\n amount of loss.These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and futu\nre events.The\n outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst\n us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome be\ncomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income Taxes\nWe\n are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.Theestablishment\n of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets.Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\n we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal\n comparable data and are inherently uncertain.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or \nactual results.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained\n upon examination.", "a561eefc-77ac-4aca-995c-760821da08c4": "Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently

of these matters will not be different.We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.To theextent\n that the final tax outcome of these matters  is different  than the amounts recorded,  such differences  may impact the provision for income taxes and theeffective tax ra\nte in the period in which such determination is made.The\n provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.In addition,we are\n subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve\nrse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67", "9feef9fe-6652-4f63-9a8a-ec0bc2cd01b7": "Insurance ReservesWe\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and

adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate\n unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported\n as of the balance sheet date.The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss\n experience.In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider\n frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known.Adjustm\nents, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates\n of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance\n claim settlement process.Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.Actual resultsdepend\n upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments.As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.While management be\nlieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour\n board of directors and non-employees.The substantial majority

interest rate.The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022\nExpected volatility.We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour\n own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term.Where, in some cases, our common share

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe\n are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\nWe\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f\ninancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69", "e8ca7e87-f4a6-4d3c-8902-e879a70cf436": "ITEM 8.

reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation\n of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately an\nd fairly reflect the transactionsand\n dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with\n generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management\n and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71", "9efbcfd7-adeb-48d9-81d8-c5717fe81365": "prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters\nThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)\n involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers.For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.Valuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical claim and loss experience.", "2e0ceaf2-6fa0-4066-9eef-a766890b71d6": "In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim

(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).Uber connectsconsumers\n (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)\n with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother\n delivery services.Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\n \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks.Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry.Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances.On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates.We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets.The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration.Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer.Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.", "09c52446-761e-49b5-8e12-e2dc4b00bdf3": "We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented.Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.We rely on alimited\n number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.Payment serviceproviders\n are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe\n have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.Our  operations  havehistorically\n been funded through equity and debt financings.While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolvingcredit\n facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,additional capital may\n need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able toobtain additional\n82", "2c121a2a-b440-4938-9e2f-e86464785e95": "financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be

market  and  economicconditions globally.In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.We  consider  all  highly-liquid  investments  purchased  with  an  original  or  remaining  maturity  of  threemonths\n or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, whichare included in accru\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash\n and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies andalso\n include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.Restricted cash and cash equivalents areclassified\n as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction.The

The timing of settlement of amounts due from theseparties\n varies by region and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.Refer to Note 10 \u2013 Supplemental Finan\ncial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although\n we  pre-authorize  forms  of  payment  to  mitigate  our  exposure,  we  bear  the  cost  of  any  accounts  receivable  losses.  We  record  an  allowance  fordoubtful\n accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for\n fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as costof\n revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographicaltrends,\n which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card losses were$195 million, $178 million and $246 m\nillion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\n\u2011 linemethod over the estima\nted useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and Equipment\nEstimated Useful Life Land\nIndefinite Buildings\n30-45 years Site improvements\n5-15 years Leased vehicles\n3-10 years Computer equipment\n3-5 years Furniture and fixtures\n3-5 years Dockless e-bikes\n3 years Internal-use software\n2 years Leased computer equipment\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termLeasehold improvements\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termWhen assets are retired\n or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain orloss is reflected\n in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life arecharged to operating expens\nes as incurred.We capitalize c\nertain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use\n software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completedand\n the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and beginsonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together \nwith costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed asincurred. In addition, we cap\nitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle\n assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for saleas of\n December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd. (\u201cWaydrive\u201d) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd.(\u201cLCR\u201d),\n a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore.

\u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.We\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease.ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received.Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date.The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.Operating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets.Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets.For operating leases, lease expense is

U.S.Acquisitions\nWe\n account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d).Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date.The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.Upon the conclusionof\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\nted statements of operations.Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\n to benefit from the business combination.We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired.We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\n value allocation approach.",

not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\nrment testing is not required.However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is

marketable equity securities inpublicly\n traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.Certain investmentsin\n non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions\n for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable\n equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable\n equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue\n on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators.Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.If  animpairment\n exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment.We include \ninvestments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities\nAccounting\n for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value.Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude\n commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds.As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities\n with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities.Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale\n debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn\nings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As\n of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone\n year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de\nbt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-\nfor-sale Debt SecuritiesWe\n account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).Weadopted\n ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).In circumstanceswhere\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.", "e6019989-a84f-4aec-84d2-c984305d44b9": "Incircumstances\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.The factors considered in determining whether acredit\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\n actions, as well as other factors.To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\n of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\n income (loss).Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.Improvements inexpected cash flows due to imp\nrovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nInvestments\n in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial\n interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.Investments accounted forunder\n the equity method are initially recorded at cost.Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to theinvestment\n balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences.We record our share of the results ofequity\n method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method

business circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value of th\ne investment may not be fully recoverable.We recognize in the86", "aa1af03b-1b71-4499-83a8-27c7be8d39be": "consolidated statements of

ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity\n that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable.We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\n measurement date.In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value.The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs.The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\n accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.Refer  to Note 3 \u2013Investments and Fair Value Me\nasurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities\nWe\n evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.If we determine that anentity\n for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial\n statements.The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly\n affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially\n be significant to the VIE.Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether\n we are still the primary beneficiary.If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with app\nlicable GAAP.", "cb6c817f-cf3c-4faf-ae33-e5f4c4ba6afa": "Refer to Note 16

periodically re\nassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87", "0dfe1fac-e5ef-49c0-8629-ba55661fe0fa": "Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe\n primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\n and Merchants for each transaction.Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The\n acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\n markets.We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.For the year endedDecember\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\nivery transactions.In all\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\nr customers.Principal vs.Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.We evaluate the presentationof\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.\u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e.\u201cnet\u201d).This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\n the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery\n service to end-users.We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.", "bcb565f0-e829-4491-bdd1-6d0c3b23af48": "While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\ne services provided to end-users.In\n the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users.Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\n to Drivers and Merchants.In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\n services.In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\nces.Mobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\norm.We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \na trip.88", "2d40b663-5b71-4fba-908f-981626726eab": "In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.We generally collect ourservice fee\n from Drivers for these trips by

cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded\n collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected\n from Drivers.Mobility revenue also inc\nludes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.Delivery\nWe\n derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete\n a meal delivery service on the platform.In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods.We r\necognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In\n the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price.The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween\n the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers.End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay\n Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery.Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction.Wetypically receive the service fee \nwithin a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.Freight\nWe\n derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese\n services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis.The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis\n in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to

principal or agent in transactions with Shippers.For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe\n are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper.We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat\n meets the Shipper's specifications.We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.Accordingly,\n we are the principal in these transactions.In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the relatedrevenue on a net

recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue.Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service

the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive.Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs.Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the

sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks.Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and

expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contractswith an original expected \nlength of one year or less.We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition

basis over the requisiteservice period, which is gene\nrally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting\n conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,typically\n the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free

publicly traded companies in our industry group.The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant witha\n term equal to the expected term.We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201doptions, as\n our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a

on our historical volatility.We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used

Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in lessactive\n markets, or models using market observable inputs.

The  price  in  these  transactions  generally  provides  the  best  indication  of  theenterprise\n value of the investee.

in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value.Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility\n are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.In thefuture, depending on the weight of \nevidence and valuation

securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment\n indicators.This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities.As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services.These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity.Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach.The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario.As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter

Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\nship interest to approximately 33%.The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\n significant influence over MLU B.V.The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V.The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020\nDuring\n 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest.The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilut\nion of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%.The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto\n our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous\n driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparingthe\n fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companiesthat\n have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, agoodwill impairment charge\n of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration ofimpairments\n of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit.

for the notes themselves.The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\n (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to

volatility.Effective\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach.The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\n of

January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level.However, ourmanagement\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\n will be met.Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\n Act).Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal\n Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).Based on thatassessment,\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021.You can find the fu\nll text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting\n for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred.Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal\n control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d), which we acquired inNovember\n 2021, as discussed in Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.We have included the financial results ofthese\n in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related toDrizly\n and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 3% and 4% ofour consolidated total ass\nets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.ITEM 9B.OTHER INFORMATION\nNot applicable.ITEM 9C.DISCLOSURE REGAR\nDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONSNot applicable.PART III\nITEM 10.", "b79b9003-fe1c-469d-a543-9c71f79a5a6e": "DIRECTORS,\n EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe\n information required by this item is set forth under the headers \u201cProposal 1- Election of Directors,\u201d \u201cExecutive Officers,\u201d \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d and\u201cOther\n Governance Matters\u201d in our Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal yearended December 31, 2021 (\u201c2022 Proxy State\nment\u201d) and is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 11.EXECUTIVE CO\nMPENSATION147", "12331cfe-3b83-4b81-b6ba-4b1f008f592e": "The information required by this item is included under the headers \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d \u201cExecutive Compensation\u201d and \u201cCompensation CommitteeInterlocks and Insider Par\nticipation\u201d in the 2022 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 12.
