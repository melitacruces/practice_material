Business.Our Mission\nImprove people\u2019s lives with \nthe world\u2019s best transportation.Overview\nLyft,\n Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission.Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d).Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\n change.Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\n in Canada.We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work.As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation.We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft\n Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings.We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\ned period of time for personal use.We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders.We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace.As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue.We also generate revenue fromriders\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\n marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\n have made focused and substantial  investments  in support of our mission.For example,  to continually  launch new innovations on our platform,  we haveinvested\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions.We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness.Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses.Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network.Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\nader in TaaS.", "38387d13-f2b3-4d2c-aa1c-ccfc08d43b35": "Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.Through  our  LyftUpinitiative,\n we\u2019re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code.We arealso\n proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change.We\u2019ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.We believe many users a\nre loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.Our\n values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business.We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services,including\n a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment.As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for ourofferings will continue to g\nrow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.5", "3dbcf978-a033-4661-a3a9-913aa23c25ec": "Impact of COVID-19 to our BusinessThe\n ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the\n impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto\n be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich\n may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor\n recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe\n office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\nFor\n more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

to\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\n safe rides programs.We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\u2022\nGrow Active Riders.We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.We may make incrementalinvestments in our\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft.We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency.We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels.Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\u2022\nGrow Our Share of Consumers\u2019

react to thesecompetitive\n challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnationthat could adversely af\nfect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via.Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market includeLime\n and Bird.Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces.We also compete with ce\nrtain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,\n there  are  other  non-U.S.-based  TaaS  network  companies,  non-ridesharing  transportation  network  companies  and  traditional  automotivemanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Cana\nda, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe.There arealso\n a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with

anticipate continued challengesfrom current compet\nitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.We\n believe we can compete favorably.However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longeroperating\n histories,  larger  marketing  budgets  and  established  marketing  relationships,  access  to  larger  customer

business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.\u201d\nSeasonality\nThe revenue we generate f\nrom our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays.We expect thedemand\n for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dryseasons.Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19.In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand.Although we have seensome\n signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recoveryremain\n uncertain.We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures,\n as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstandingusual seasonality.Our Brand and Marketing\nWe\n believe good energy moves the world.The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight.Our marketingefforts\n bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and socialmedia engagement.We \nalso benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider communityOur\n marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers andriders.Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,and outdoor advertisements.We\n use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend.We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising,\n radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more.We continue to engage with current riders througha variety of initia\ntives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.Our Commitment to Safety\nA\n

a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback.At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars.Any rider ordriver\n who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details.Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never bematched with that

employees  inapproximately\n 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks.Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineer\ning, design and science organizations.Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We\n believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority.We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees\n reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger.As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male\n and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall.The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8%\n Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.We\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement.We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone\n Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe \nrecruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of\n the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness.We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive yea\nr to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation.We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019\n annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent\n demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family.Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors\n not accounted for in the statistical models we used.In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate b\nusiness factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty \nand as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are rep\nresented

We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding\n transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, b\nike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\n\u2022\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\n\u2022\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\n\u2022\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\nities of color.In\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why.

disrupted and harmed, and is expected to continue to disrupt and harm, our business, financial condition and results of operations.Weare\n unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operationsand the achievement of our strategic obj\nectives.Our\n business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, suchas\n travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders.The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,\n decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply chains,  and  significant  volatility  and disruption  of  financialmarkets.The\n COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\n\u2022\nDeclines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich\n has decreased our revenues.These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform.Wepaused our\n shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021.While certain typesof\n travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior\n arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\u2022\nChanges in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets.This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted\n and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nation.\u2022\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations\n to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily\n to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto\n vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform.The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting\n systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident.Tothe\n extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maint\nain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022\nWe design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles\n that meet our standards is critical to our operations.We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared LightVehicles\n and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services.We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemicrelated\n to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  faceadditional\n challenges in future periods.These challenges may adversely affect our ability to deploy new Light Vehicles on our network or to implement

program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto\n COVID-19.For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19.Further, while ExpressDrive\n rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020,

Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach\n of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the futu\nre, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19",

replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards

operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons,many\n of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict.Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, theresults\n of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operationsto\n fluctuate in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or theexpectations of analysts o\nr investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to

not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Prior\n to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,particularly\n after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all.In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it isuncertain\n whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance.Our success will depend to a substantial extent on thewillingness\n of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings.We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact thewillingness\n of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters.In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings(though\n we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from

discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of su\nch evaluations.Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.Our\n continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease\n utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle.If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our plat\nform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or\n superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour\n requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof\n our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business.For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased.This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted.Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure.Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient.Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.Thisincludes\n a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal \nwith Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal).If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment\n model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions.We may face specific risksrelating\n to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.If\n drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria\n and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected.Further, incentives we provide to attract driverscould\n fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences.", "86cc9bef-4d05-4354-a404-65061b9e0213": "In addition, changesin\n certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws or background check

being collected.Other\n factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles orinsurance, or concerns about\n the availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of driverson\n our platform or utilization of our

certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies\n which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions.In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related r\nisk from some third-party insurance providers.In connection

riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand.We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride.The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match.Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition

platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties.As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated.We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.In

their proprietar\ny technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies\n in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.As we gain an increasingly  high public  profile  and the number  of competitors  in our market  increases  and as we continue to develop new technologies  andintellectual\n property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our mark\nets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion.From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us.See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional\n information about these types of legal

is satisfactory to us.Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us.In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights.Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation.We may be required to pay substantialdamages,\n royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing\n or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations.With\n respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot\n be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and

information securitystandards\n and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRAimposing\n new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, wemay\n face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effortto\n do so.In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased

protection.If ourarbitration agreements were found to be\n unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein\n our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our bus\niness,

on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing ourofferings\n or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.Although  we  have  reserved  for  potential  payments  of  possible  past  taxliabilities in our financial stateme\nnts, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Additionally,\n one  or  more  states,  localities  or  other  taxing  jurisdictions  may  seek  to  impose  additional  reporting,  record-keeping  or  indirect  tax  collectionobligations\n on businesses like ours.For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,collect and remit indirect taxes f\nor transactions taking place46", "bce6914c-9048-44eb-a725-e792fd3401e3": "over the Internet, and are considering related legislation.After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South  Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain  states have enacted laws thatwould\n require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online.Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which wouldharm\n our business.New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audi\nt requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As\n a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference\n may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.Operating as\n a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited exper\nience managing a public company.As\n a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the\n Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules\n and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.For  example,  the  Exchange  Act  requires,  among  other  things,  we  file  annual,quarterly\n and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls andprocedures\n and internal control over financial reporting.Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financialcompliance\n costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additionalsubstantial\n costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we  cannot  currently  anticipate.As  a  result  of  disclosure  ofinformation\n in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,including by competitors.Certain\n members  of  our  management  team  have  limited  experience  managing  a  publicly  traded  company,  interacting  with  public  company  investors  andcomplying\n with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies.Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being apublic\n company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts andinvestors.These  obligations  and  constituents  will  require  significant  attention  from  our  senior  management  and  could  divert  their  attention  away  from  the  day-to-daymanagement of our business, which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change may have a long-term i\nmpact on our business.We have established environmental programs, such as our\n commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure theefficient\n use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks whereverbusiness\n is conducted.For example,  our San Francisco,  California  headquarters  is projected  to  be vulnerable  to future  water  scarcity  and sea level  rise  due to climatechange,\n as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs.Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weatherevents\n and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of ourcustomers,\n and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.Additionally, we are subject to emerging climatechange policies\n such as California\u2019s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meetthe\n future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company.", "dbd58ca5-a38e-406d-908a-025a930dba0a": "We advocate for EVprograms\n that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and

investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation,\n asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful,\n our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.We may also enter into arrangements with thirdparties\n for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030.Such transactions may require us toprovide\n guarantees for financing.We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to usethem, we may not realiz\ne the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.Risks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\nWe may require additional capital,

rights,  preferences  or  privileges  senior  to those  of  our Class  Acommon\n stock,  and  our  existing  stockholders  may  experience  dilution.Further,  we  have  secured  debt  financing  which  has  resulted  in  fixed  obligations  and  certainrestrictive\n covenants,  and any  debt financing  secured  by  us in  the future  would result  in increased  fixed  obligations  and could

announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir\n indexes.In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures\n to be included in their indices.Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap

possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat\n are included.Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake\n similar actions.Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude\n investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.As a result, the market price of our

Canada  and  globally.Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site.Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform.Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although\n we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic,\n demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts.The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain.Theextent\n to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted,\n including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand\n private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things.For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany\n businesses to delay employees returning to the office.", "18f415b5-9cca-4608-b113-15554caf9e8d": "Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us.The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues

Developments\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. \n(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On\n July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor

fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  andcommercialization of\n the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing.We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\n operation.We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated\n statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial

(\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\u201cReinsurance\n Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace\n as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date.Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG\n approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate\n limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d).The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits\n obligations to the policyholder.A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine mon\nths ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\nThe\n COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and  in  revenue  per  Active  Rider  beginning  March  2020.Though  we  experienced  arecovery in\n revenue per Active Rider and the number of Active Riders in 2021, the

Riders as \nall riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction.An Active Rider is identified bya\n unique phone number.If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\n as two Active Riders.If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider.If a ride has been requested by an\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\nible in the Lyft App.Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account.Accordingly,Lyft\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\n ride in the Lyft App.This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\n fully reopened.Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders.Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021.This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide.Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beg\ninning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur\n consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are

with Customers (ASC 606)\nWe\n generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders.We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse\n of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Drivers enter into terms ofservice (\u201cToS\u201d) with us in orde\nr to use our Lyft Driver App.58", "e0e0b024-a116-4421-af25-60c32b6014df": "We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders.This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform.As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider.We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider.The driver fulfills their promise to pro\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\n price through the platform.We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices.As a result\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\n consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606.As our customary business practice, a contract existsbetween\n the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider.We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\n behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\n\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\nd to the rider.In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\n the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be

utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure\n costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate\n law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet\n reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.Liabilities are determined ona\n quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss\n development factors among other inputs and assumptions.On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience.Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions\n based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves.A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic\n and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation.Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from\n previous actuarial projections.The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However, while webelieve\n that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.As a result, the net amounts that willultimately\n be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We\n continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and e\nconomic environment evolves.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based comp\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).We\n estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel.The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.Werecognize compensation \nexpense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a

date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based\n on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest

estimated fair values on the acquisition date.The excess of the fair value ofpurchase\n consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.When

value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair value of assetsreceived.Intangible \nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill\n is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying\n amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable.As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether\n further impairment testing is necessary.If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quant\nitative impairment test will be required.There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \nNote 2 to  our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere

first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million\n for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe\n prior period.We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these

Agreement,  but  are  below  the  aggregate  limit  of  $434.5  million  may  result  in  therecognition\n of a deferred gain liability.When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are

Item 9A.Our responsibility is\n to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reportingbased\n on our audits.We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to beindependent\n with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.We\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\n about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was mai\nntained in all material respects.Our\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe\n amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as\n evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan\n understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our au\ndits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.Webelieve that our audits p\nrovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\ntingA\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial\n statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.", "6d101d16-65ba-4cc1-b3c5-a124f9a1aad9": "A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes\n those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof\n the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally\n accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors\n of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have\n a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures m\nay deteriorate.75", "de5642eb-c4cf-41c9-996d-859cec0a0950": "Critical Audit MattersThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)involved\n our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  theconsolidated\n financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical auditmatters or on the accoun\nts or disclosures to which they relate.Valuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance,which\n may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage,first\n party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves\n totaled $1,069 million.Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas\n one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves.Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis\n of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming\n procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss d\nevelopment factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the\n matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods\n and the loss development factors.These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge\n to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s\n actuarially  determined  reserves.Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  bymanagement, and independen\ntly developing loss development factors.Valuation of Certain Elements of the Transac\ntion with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As\n described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation,\n for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof\n Lyft rideshare and fleet data.The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand\n $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration\n was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization\n of Lyft rideshare and fleet data.", "75dc3519-bf50-40fb-980c-7cd422f3d016": "For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certainassets\n related  to  the  Level  5  division,  which  was  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets,  valued  under  the  replacement  cost  method,  and  the  estimatedstandalone\n selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach.The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used toestimate\n the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the standaloneselling price of the r\nideshare data.The principal\n considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain elements of the transaction with Woven Planet isa\n critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  a high degree  of auditor  judgment  and  subjectivity  in performing  procedures  relating  to the  fair  value  of  the Level  5 division  assets  andestimated\n standalone selling price of the rideshare data due to the significant judgment by management when determining the values; (ii) the significant audit effort inevaluating\n management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license; and(iii) the audit ef\nfort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.76", "b596a7c3-5ff0-4438-9550-f98c26769abd": "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the transaction with Woven Planet, including controls over the Company\u2019s valuationmethods,\n significant  assumptions  and  data.

Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumption related to the obsolescence curve involvedconsidering\n the estimated life of comparable acquired technology. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumption related to the estimated milesused\n to  recreate  the  data  produced  from  the  rideshare  license  assumption  involved  considering  other  comparable  data  licensing  agreements  as  well  as  assessing  forconsistency\n with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets\n and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring\n the reporting periods.The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected\n future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from \nother sources.Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85", "18a2380d-2a13-46e8-9fcd-c8fc2f10db99": "Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland\n identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.\nBeginning\n in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.\n The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\n headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events. The\n Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements,\n the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's\n assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\n on the consolidated  financial  statements  as soon as they become known. Actual  results could differ  from those estimates  and any such differences  may bematerial to the Company'\ns financial statements.Segment Information\nOperating\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\n Decision  Maker  (\u201cCODM\u201d)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company\u2019s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\n is  the Company\u2019s  CODM. The  CODM reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\nThe\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\n mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognizedin\n accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensingand\n data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles andLyft Rentals, which is recogniz\ned in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d).The table below presents the Comp\nany's revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Revenue from contracts with \ncustomers (ASC 606)$ 2,957,979 $ 2,208,656 $ 3,465,473 Rental revenue (ASC 842)\n250,344 156,025 150,487 Total revenue\n$ 3,208,323 $ 2,364,681 $ 3,615,960 86", "07dc1653-05b2-419c-82ab-55cef3251541": "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)The Company\n recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606.The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App.Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers.The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\n transportation service to a rider.The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.As\n the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\n is upon pickup of the rider.The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\n transportation service for riders.The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\n ride.The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606.The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.The\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements.The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis.Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals.Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies.TheCompany\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842.Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable.For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements.Drivers who rent v\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.Due\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases.Revenuegenerated\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride.Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over th\ne rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe\n Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider\u2019s authorized payment method.", "4da90259-9860-4788-8bbc-37da723caed5": "Uncollected fees areincluded\n in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company\u2019s  enterpriseprograms (\u201cEnterprise Users\u201d), where the transacti\nons have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as ofthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled wit\nh third-party payment processors.Underthe\n ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related chargesit\n collects from riders on behalf of drivers.Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers.The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers isincluded in accrued and oth\ner current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.The\n Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected.As a result of the adoption ofAccounting\n Standards Update No.2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\" (\u201cASC 326\u201d), the Company\u2019s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has beenaugmented to reflect the chan\nge from the incurred loss87", "db22579e-5387-4a0d-ab00-e6c3a44ab9cd": "model to the expected credit loss model.The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\n receivables  balance.In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability.The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\n Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\n and 2019, respectively.The write-offs were immaterial  for the year ended December 31, 2021.The change in the allowance  for credit losses for the year endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs.The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs.The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.Incentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform.Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while riders,  Light Vehicle  riders and Lyft Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or discounted  rides  under such incentive  programs.Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price.As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method.Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue.Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received.Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense.The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received.The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform.Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company.Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.An example isa\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\n a targeted group of riders.The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.", "95ab0296-1bb1-4175-acb1-eeac53184386": "These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs.When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\nRider  referral programs.Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform.The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded to sales and marketing  expense.Referral  coupons typically  expire within one year.The Company estimates breakage  using its historicalexperience.As of December 31, 2021 \nand 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88", "31077eac-8014-477c-bda1-08baf4659526": "Light Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter IncentivesIncentives offered to L\night Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years

theCompany\n recorded $1.3 billion, $390.8 million and $560.3 million as a reduction to revenue and $64.7 million, $135.0 million and $381.5 million as sales and marketingexpense, respectively.Refunds\nFrom\n time  to  time  the  Company  issues  credits  or  refunds  to  riders  unsatisfied  by  the  level  of  service  provided  by  the  driver.There  is  no  legal  obligation  toremunerate\n such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers.The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are notrecoverable\n from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred.For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, rider refunds were $19.1 million,$18.8\n million and $33.9 million, respectively.The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $6.5 million for theyear ended December 31, 2021.For the y\nears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders were not material.Cost of Revenue\nCost\n of  revenue  consists  of  costs  directly  related  to  revenue  generating  transactions  through  the  Company\u2019s  multimodal  platform  which  primarily  includesinsurance\n costs, payment processing charges, and other costs.Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing andbike\n and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers.Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.Other\n costs  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,amortization of technology-relate\nd intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.Operations and Support\nOperations\n and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email andchat support to\n users, bike and scooter fleet operations support

RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.The\n Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.The Black-Schol\nes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards.", "ace25e1b-8d36-4d14-92d7-f51ca3b72406":

simplified method for \u201cplain vanilla\u201d stock option awards.The expected term of the ESPPpurchase\n rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period.Since the Company has limited history as apublic\n company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights\n using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies.The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues simila\nr in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The\n fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.TheCompany recognizes compensat\nion expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PS\nUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined\n based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both \na service condition and a performance condition.Compensation\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration\n Statement on  March 28, 2019.On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for \nthe RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019.The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service period\ns. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condit\nion only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based\n compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures.Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessar\ny, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income Taxes\nThe\n Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe\n estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that\n are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse.The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date.The Compa\nny records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net\n amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized.Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and \nrisks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions\n of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby\n the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open.ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more \nlikely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any

business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof\n purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.The excess of the fairvalue\n of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.When determining the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities\n assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are basedupon assumptions believed to be r\neasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,90",

\naccounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted\n cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged\n to secure certain letters of credit.Investments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investme\nnts in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and\n the  nature  of  the  transaction.Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt sec\nurities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The\n Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\nolidated statements of operationsas\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\n recovery of its amortized cost basis.If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors.Inmaking\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured\n based on  the  Company's best  estimate  of  the cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.When  developing  its estimate  of  cash  flows expected  to  be collected,  theCompany\n considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.Credit\n loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidate\nd statements of operations.Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe\n amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.As of December 31,

measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence ofobservable\n transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment.The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist.Factors\n considered in this assessment include the investees\u2019 financial and liquidity

or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents.Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists.The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.Fair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.Level\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\n values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.Light Vehicle Fleet\nThe\n Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters.Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months.As of December 3\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service.As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\n million.As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million.As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\n service was not material.Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.Bikes are \nincluded in property and equipment, net on the

not separate lease and non-leasecomponents,\n such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements.Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the\n period over which the lease arrangement occurs.Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease\n revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements.The Company mitigatesresidual\n value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present \nand estimated future market conditions.Lessee\nThe\n Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe\n Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals.For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand\n lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term.The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat\n the Company will exercise such options.The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo\n so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements.For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease lia\nbilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The\n Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate.Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments\n based on information available at lease commencement.The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collat\neralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Compan\ny\u2019s lease liability calculation.Operating leases are included inoperating\n lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases\n are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term.Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current lia\nbilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful\n lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.The interest component of finance leases is included incost of\n revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operat\ning expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and Equipment\nProperty\n and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe\n related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance\n and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized.When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costand\n accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in theperiod\n realized.Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets.Construction inprogress is related to prop\nerty and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management\u2019s estimate of the fair value ofassets received.", "68381168-ac35-462d-b788-65ffe554ed28": "Intang\nible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two

carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value.As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitativeassessment\n to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of theCompany\u2019s\n reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.Alternatively,  the  Company  may  bypass  the  qualitativeassessment and perform a qu\nantitative impairment test.There was

may not be fully recoverable.Such events and changes  may include:  significant  changes in performancerelative\n to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy.The Company measuresrecoverability\n of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate.If thecarrying value\n of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.Therewas no impairment of long-l\nived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development Costs\nThe\n Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems.The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform\n and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform\n the function intended.The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software

Reserves\nThe\n Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underi\nnsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder\n state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions.On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims  may take years to completely settle,  and the Company has limited  historical loss experience.Because of the limited operational  history, theCompany\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves.A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation.Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections.The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.As aresult,\n the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe\n consolidated balance sheets.The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are report\ned and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net\n loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The\n two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand\n participation rights in undistributed earnings.The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between commonstock\n and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.", "1327bb07-ffcc-49fb-8485-a10bbb5c3d3c": "The

(\u201cFlexdr\nive\u201d)On\n February 7, 2020 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Flexdrive for approximately $20.0 million and treated the acquisition as abusiness\n combination.The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company's current business, and help expand the range of the Company's use cases.Prior\n to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive\u2019s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers.As of the Closing Date, theCompany\n had  approximately  $133.1  million  of  operating  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  $130.1  million  of  operating  lease  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  related  to  thispreexisting\n contractual relationship with Flexdrive.This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchaseprice, resulting in a to\ntal acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.95",

fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years.The fair value of thedeveloped\n technology was determined using the avoided cost approach.In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare\n avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date.Indications of value were developed by discountingthese benefits to thei\nr present value.The\n results of operations for the acquired business

this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,accordingly, pro forma f\ninancial information has not been presented.Other Acquisitions\nIn the fourth

\n(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company com\npleted a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets\n related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commerci\nalization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing.The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transa\nction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting\n as  a  discontinued  operation.As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable\n to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare\n and fleet data.The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which

Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements ofoperations.\nIn March 2020, the Company purchased a\n non-marketable equity security for total cash consideration of $10.0 million that is classified in other investments on theconsolidated balance she\nets.In\n June 2021, the Company received an investment in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily determinable market valueas part of licensing and data\n access agreements. The investment had a carrying value of $64.0 million and is categorized as Level 3. The Company does not have significantinfluence\n over this privately-held company and has elected to measure this investment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on theconsolidated balance she\net.

Leases\nReal Estate Operating Leases\nThe\n Company leases real estate property at approximately 81 locations of which all leases have commenced as of December 31, 2021. These leases are classifiedas operating leases. As of Dece\nmber 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary from one month to eight years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the leaseterm\n for  periods  varying  from  two  months  to  ten  years.  These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany\n will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe\n fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted \nfor as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive Program\nThe\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases areclassified\n as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms varybetween one month to three ye\nars. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated tothe respective leas\ne component.104", "107a0239-1be3-42ad-acfa-4740ba7d60b3": "Lease Position as of December 31, 2021The\n table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms andpercentages):\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020 Operating Leases\nAssets\nOperating lease right-o\nf-use assets$ 223,412 $ 275,756 Liabilities\nOperating lease liabi\nlities, current$ 53,765 $ 49,291 Operating lease liabi\nlities, non-current210,232 265,803 Total operating lease liabilities\n$ 263,997 $ 315,094 Finance Leases\nAssets\nFinance lease right-of\n-use assets$ 26,802 $ 28,108 Liabilities\nFinance lease liabil\nities, current13,556 20,795 Finance lease liabil\nities, non-current14,242 6,593 Total finance lease liabilities\n$ 27,798 $ 27,388 Weighted-average remaining lease term\n (years)Operating leases\n5.6 6.3 Finance leases\n2.2 1.5 Weighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases\n6.3 %6.4 %Finance leases\n2.8 %4.7 %_______________\n(1)\nThis  balance  is  included  within  property and  equipment,  net  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  was primarily  related  to  leases  acquired  in  the  Flexdrive  transaction.

regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary\n course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense\n related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,\n or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public di\nsclosures about the business.In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\n of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.For some matters for which a material lossis\n reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies.Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.Independent Contractor Classificat\nion MattersWith\n regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigation\ns and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers\n as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can cr\neate uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For\n example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.Labor  Code  sec.2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new\n standard for determining employee or independent contractor status.The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform.", "763b9d46-31a4-42ac-beb4-32cf8c93027d": "For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\n material damages and penalties.On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit.Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law.Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22.On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber.The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court.On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution.The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021.Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021.Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit.On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable.Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal.Briefing is currently underway.Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.In September 2021, the Massachusetts Attorney Generalserved Lyft and Uber with a motion \nfor summary judgment on the issue of108", "8dfd101a-0723-49b5-a449-fdfb2ef9c070":

California, Oregon,Wisconsin,\n Illinois,  New  York,  New  Jersey  and  North  Carolina.The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans

by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recordedto general and administ\nrative expenses.Indirect Taxes\nThe\n Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters.The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises fromdisputes\n on  tax  treatment

currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course ofbusiness,\n the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or assertinginfringement\n of such property.The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing

Mat\ntersIn\n the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable fordamages\n related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from thirdparties.The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers on the Lyft Platform, other riders,renters and third part\nies.The Company believes it has meritorious

proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company\u2019s opinion, is likely tohave\n a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legalproceedings\n related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.For\n example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating toalleged\n sexual  assault  or  harassment  by  drivers  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  a  Judicial  Council  Coordinated  Proceeding  has  been  created  before  the  Superior  Court  ofCalifornia, County of\n San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending.Regardless of the outcome of

factors.Although\n the Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages oflitigation\n and present a wide range of potential outcomes.The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonablyestimable.Securities Litigation\nBeginning\n in  April 2019,  multiple  putative  class  actions  and derivative  actions  have  been filed  in state  and federal  courts  against  the Company,  its directors,certain\n of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and othercauses\n of action in connection with the IPO.The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal\n court.The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California.On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand\n overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint.The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020.On February26,\n 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint\n on March 17, 2021.The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer\n but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend.The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion\n to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass\n action proceeding in federal court.In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part an\nd denied in part that motion.The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,and\n the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022.On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they hadreached\n an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis.In the consolidated derivative action, at the parties\u2019 joint request, the California federal courtstayed\n the case on February 17, 2021.Although the Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, the Company hasaccrued amounts rela\nted to such matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.10.",

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.None.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur\n management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand\n procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the periodcovered by this\n Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December31, 2021, our disclosure controls and pro\ncedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Repor\ntingOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)under\n the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of conso\nlidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our\n management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as\n of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations\n of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\nThe\n effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public ac\ncounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere\n were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange\n Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including\n our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all\n errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance\n that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be consider\ned relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and inst\nances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because\n of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the\n controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and\n there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause\n of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to e\nrror or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C.
